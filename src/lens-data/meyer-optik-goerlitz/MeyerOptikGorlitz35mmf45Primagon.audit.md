## 2026-09-28 — Patent figure, glass, and metadata audit

Source: `patents/DE_1749770_U.pdf`, PDF p. 6 (single optical section). Original prescription coordinates were checked visually against the source table; published radii, axial spacings, indices, Abbe numbers and image-plane distances are preserved.

### Optical rims

600 dpi crop: 0.14,0.24,0.77,0.65; axis 0.443. Automated rear rows are contaminated by leaders and the tilted axis. Manual optical-rim estimates using the ≈529 px glass span at 1400 px page height give ≈20, 6.9, 5.0 and 5.3 mm, within about 15% of existing 19, 7.5, 4.8 and 5.7 mm. Retained.

Stop diameter and inferred stop location are unchanged. No focus-motion law is added.

### Glass classification

| Element | Before resolution | After resolution | Patent nd / νd |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | Abbe fallback | FK5 | 1.48709 / 70.3 |
| L2 | Abbe fallback | N-SSK5 | 1.65883 / 51 |
| L3 | Abbe fallback | F7 | 1.62542 / 35.5 |
| L4 | Abbe fallback | H-ZK1 | 1.56905 / 63 |

Resolved catalog curves are qualified spectral proxies. They do not identify historical suppliers or melts. No patent coordinates are changed and no catalog line indices or anomalous-dispersion flags are copied into the lens data. The analysis glass table is synchronized.

Added H-ZK1 from the official CDGM datasheet, https://www.cdgmgd.com/webapp/pdf/H-ZK1.pdf (accessed 2026-09-28), including all six published Sellmeier constants, nd 1.56888 and νd 62.96. It improves the crown-class proxy match without claiming historical CDGM supply.

### Metadata and display

Existing display name retained; product correlation remains qualified in the analysis.
