 * ║  TELECONVERTER DATA — FUJIFILM FUJINON TELECONVERTER XF1.4X TC F2 WR ║
 * ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
 * ║  Data source: US 11,079,573 B2, EXAMPLE 1, rear converter lens RCL — ║
 * ║    rows 35–45 of Table 3, the surface numbers the text assigns to    ║
 * ║    the converter (Fujifilm Corporation / Tetsuya Ori; filed 26 June  ║
 * ║    2019, priority JP 2018-133425 of 13 July 2018, granted 3 August   ║
 * ║    2021). Cross-sections: FIG. 1 (converter alone) and FIG. 3        ║
 * ║    (Example 1 mounted on the master lens).                           ║
 * ║  Adapted from the reviewed master-plus-converter package for this    ║
 * ║  example: only the converter rows are kept here, and the host lens   ║
 * ║  supplies the stop and the f-number.                                 ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Production correlation: 7 elements in 4 air-separated groups, a     ║
 * ║    doublet, a triplet and two singlets with the sixth lens           ║
 * ║    aspherical, as in Fujifilm's published section and specification  ║
 * ║    of the XF1.4X TC F2 WR. The paraxial magnification is 1.3996      ║
 * ║    against the marketed 1.4×, and the priority date precedes the     ║
 * ║    product's release. The correlation is not manufacturer-confirmed. ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Design: three lens groups, positive–negative–positive, in four      ║
 * ║  air-separated components. Converter focal length −56.47 mm.         ║
 * ║    RG1 (RL1a+RL1b, cemented doublet)       — positive, f = +62.40    ║
 * ║    RG2 (RL2a+RL2b+RL2c, cemented triplet)  — negative, f = −18.04    ║
 * ║    RG3 (RL3a, RL3b, air-spaced singlets)   — positive, f = +61.69    ║
 * ║  RL3a carries both aspherical surfaces. Glass: the patent prints     ║
 * ║  nd/νd only. Each pair equals a catalog entry to the printed         ║
 * ║  precision (CDGM H-ZLaF68N, H-ZF1 and H-ZF4A; Ohara L-BSL7 and       ║
 * ║  S-NPH3), so the elements carry those labels and trace on catalog    ║
 * ║  dispersion data; the supplier is not confirmed.                     ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  MASTER LENS: the patent's master lens ML (Tables 1–2), a 194.02 mm  ║
 * ║    f/2.06 prime of nineteen lenses L1a–L1s. The catalog host is      ║
 * ║    `fujifilm-xf-200-f2`, transcribed from a different publication,   ║
 * ║    US 2019/0265504 A1. Its Example 1 has the same lens elements but  ║
 * ║    a back focus of 31.1415 mm in air, so the composed junction gap   ║
 * ║    is 4.2784 mm against the patent's 4.2900.                         ║
 * ║  GEOMETRY: master back focus in air 29.2741 + 2.85 / 1.5168 =        ║
 * ║    31.1531 mm (Table 2 prints 31.15), minus the Table 3              ║
 * ║    master-to-converter gap d34 = 4.2900, gives masterImageDistanceMm ║
 * ║    = 26.8631. The last gap (12.5726) is the physical distance to     ║
 * ║    optical member PP (2.85 mm, nd 1.5168, touching the image plane   ║
 * ║    Sim); with PP the combined back focus in air is 14.4516 mm        ║
 * ║    (Table 4 prints 14.45). Mounting the converter moves the image    ║
 * ║    plane back 27.41 + 14.4516 − 26.8631 = 14.9985 mm.                ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  Patent combined system (Table 4): f = 271.54 mm, Bf = 14.45 mm,     ║
 * ║    FNo. 2.88, 2ω = 6.8°.                                             ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  NOTE ON ASPHERES: patent surfaces 42 and 43, the two faces of RL3a, ║
 * ║    are labels `8A` and `9A` here (Table 5). The patent's sag         ║
 * ║    equation carries KA where this project carries 1 + K, so the      ║
 * ║    printed KA = 1 is stored as K = 0. The odd and even terms A4–A16  ║
 * ║    are kept as printed; A3 and A17–A20 print as zero.                ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  NOTE ON SEMI-DIAMETERS: the patent lists no effective diameters.    ║
 * ║    The values are the package's inferred rims for the patent's       ║
 * ║    master-plus-converter system, sized from traced full-field ray    ║
 * ║    bundles and cut back on RG1, RG2 and RL3a to the radius that      ║
 * ║    leaves the positive lens about 0.05 mm of edge. The patent        ║
 * ║    figures corroborate the topology only; the rims are not           ║
 * ║    figure-audited. Faster hosts are excluded through `minHostFno`.   ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  NOTE ON FOCUS: a virtual object at masterImageDistanceMm images     ║
 * ║    14.4517 mm behind the last vertex, 0.0002 mm from the printed     ║
 * ║    plane. The package finds the complete patent system 0.0021 mm     ║
 * ║    from paraxial focus. The printed spacings are kept.               ║
 * ║                                                                      ║
 * ║  NOTE ON SOURCE DISCREPANCIES: Table 18 prints f1/fC −1.101, f2/fC   ║
 * ║    0.320, f3/fC −1.101, ν1−ν2 5.400, f31/f3 0.614 and f32/f3 −1.477  ║
 * ║    for Example 1, while the printed rows give −1.105, 0.319, −1.092, ║
 * ║    5.38, 0.617 and −1.500. Every condition still holds and the rows  ║
 * ║    are kept as printed.                                              ║
