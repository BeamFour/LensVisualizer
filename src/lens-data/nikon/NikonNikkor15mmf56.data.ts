 * ║  LENS DATA — NIKON NIKKOR-QD·C AUTO 15mm f/5.6                               ║
 * ╠══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣
 * ║  Data source: JP S48-71634 A (Tomowaki Takahashi / Nippon Kogaku K.K.),      ║
 * ║  second numerical table, "spherical optical system (reference material)",    ║
 * ║  PDF pp. 3–4 (printed pp. 165–166): f = 15.3, F/5.6, 2ω = 110°, B.f. 38.77.  ║
 * ║  Fourteen elements in twelve groups plus the built-in filter plate F that    ║
 * ║  the table lists between L5 and L6; all surfaces spherical. The patent's     ║
 * ║  own (aspheric) embodiment and its coefficients are not used.                ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  PRODUCT CORRELATION: The table is correlated with the 1973 Nikkor-QD·C      ║
 * ║  Auto 15mm f/5.6 (14 elements / 12 groups, 110°, built-in filters) by focal  ║
 * ║  length, aperture, field, construction count, applicant and date. Nikon has  ║
 * ║  not confirmed that this table is the production prescription, and Nikon     ║
 * ║  credits the production design to Ikuo Mori rather than the patent's         ║
 * ║  inventor. Radii, glasses and iris size of the production lens may differ.   ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  SCALE: None applied. The table is published at f = 15.3 mm; the computed    ║
 * ║  paraxial EFL is 15.309 mm.                                                  ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  IMAGE PLANE: The final d is the patent's printed B.f. = 38.77 mm. The       ║
 * ║  computed paraxial BFD is 38.793 mm; the 0.023 mm difference is consistent   ║
 * ║  with rounding of the tabulated values and is left visible.                  ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  FILTER PLATE: The 1.20 mm plate (n = 1.51743, no Abbe number published) is  ║
 * ║  part of the patent table and of the production lens's built-in filter       ║
 * ║  turret, so it is drawn and traced as a Plane-Parallel Plate element. It is  ║
 * ║  not counted in elementCount / groupCount.                                   ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  NOTE ON STOP: The patent gives no diaphragm row. The stop is placed at the  ║
 * ║  midpoint of the 1.60 mm air gap between the flat faces r20 and r21 (0.80 +  ║
 * ║  0.80 mm), where Fig. 1 draws the diaphragm. Its semi-diameter is            ║
 * ║  calibrated by exact on-axis ray tracing to F/5.6 (paraxial pupil            ║
 * ║  calculation with the same iris: F/5.50); it is not a published iris size.   ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  NOTE ON SEMI-DIAMETERS: The patent lists none. Values follow the element    ║
 * ║  rims of patent Fig. 1 (PDF p. 4, 0.1317 mm/px at the 352 dpi native scan),  ║
 * ║  which draws the aspheric embodiment; its front group L1–L5 and filter       ║
 * ║  share most radii with this table, and its rims agree with the exact chief   ║
 * ║  ray of this table at the 135 corner (ω = 55.3°, Y = 21.65 mm) within about  ║
 * ║  1 mm. Surfaces 1–12 are therefore set to the figure rim or the corner       ║
 * ║  chief-ray height plus 0.1–0.6 mm, whichever is larger. Doublet D1 has       ║
 * ║  different thicknesses in this table and uses one common ray-based rim.      ║
 * ║  Behind the stop the figure is followed where it clears the axial beam; the  ║
 * ║  D2 doublet is drawn narrower than the F/5.6 axial beam and is kept          ║
 * ║  ray-based. All values are modeled clear apertures, not production           ║
 * ║  mechanical dimensions. Two geometry limits are raised because the 110°      ║
 * ║  table needs them: r2 is used to 70.4° rim slope (maxRimAngleDeg = 71; Fig.  ║
 * ║  1 draws the rear of L1 equally deep), and the L1–L2 air gap closes to 0.34  ║
 * ║  mm at the rim (gapSagFrac = 0.97).                                          ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  NOTE ON GLASS: The patent prints n and ν without naming the spectral line   ║
 * ║  or any glass. They are traced as d-line values on that assumption. Catalog  ║
 * ║  names in the glass labels are coordinate-compatible classes that supply a   ║
 * ║  dispersion curve; they do not identify the historical supplier or melt.     ║
 * ║  Six coordinates and the filter have no compatible catalog glass and stay    ║
 * ║  Unmatched (Abbe-number dispersion fallback).                                ║
 * ║                                                                              ║
 * ║  NOTE ON FOCUS: Only the infinity prescription is published. var is empty    ║
 * ║  and closeFocusM = 1e15 marks focus as not modeled; it is not a minimum      ║
 * ║  focus distance. The production lens's 0.3 m close focus and floating        ║
 * ║  correction are not reconstructed.                                           ║
