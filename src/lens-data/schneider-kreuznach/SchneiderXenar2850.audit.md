## 2026-09-28 — Patent figure, glass, and metadata audit

Source: `patents/DE_753329_C.pdf`, PDF p. 3, Fig. 1 (Zahlentafel 1). Original prescription coordinates were checked visually against the source table; published radii, axial spacings, indices, Abbe numbers and image-plane distances are preserved.

### Optical rims

600 dpi crop: 0.34,0.16,0.52,0.29; axis 0.225. Excludes the axis arrow and Fig. 2 designation schematic. Scale ≈22.22 µm/pixel; inferred SDs ≈9.5, 9.0, 8.0 and 8.1 mm. All existing rims are within about 10%; retained, including the cemented rear pair.

Stop diameter and inferred stop location are unchanged. No focus-motion law is added.

### Glass classification

| Element | Before resolution | After resolution | Patent nd / νd |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| L1 | S-BAL35 | S-BAL35 | 1.589 / 61.2 |
| L2 | Abbe fallback | S-BSM18 | 1.6375 / 56.1 |
| L3 | Abbe fallback | F5 | 1.6045 / 37.8 |
| L4 | Abbe fallback | KF3 | 1.5145 / 54.7 |
| L5 | Abbe fallback | N-SK14 | 1.6025 / 59.5 |

Resolved catalog curves are qualified spectral proxies. They do not identify historical suppliers or melts. No patent coordinates are changed and no catalog line indices or anomalous-dispersion flags are copied into the lens data. The analysis glass table is synchronized.

Image-circle floor audit is skipped because imageFormat is unset; production-variant uncertainty is preserved rather than inventing format metadata.

The source says only “yellow ray.” Catalog comparisons use the existing d-line schema approximation, not independently verified He-d provenance.

### Metadata and display

Existing display name retained; product correlation remains qualified in the analysis.
