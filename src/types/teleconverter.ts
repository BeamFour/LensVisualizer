/**
 * Type definitions for detachable rear teleconverters.
 *
 * A teleconverter is a catalog entity of its own, never a lens: it has no aperture stop, cannot be traced or drawn
 * alone, and only becomes a runtime lens after `attachTeleconverter()` composes it onto a compatible host
 * prescription. Built-in converters that ship inside one lens stay on `OpticalConfigurationData`.
